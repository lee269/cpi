To do

- strip out latest date and next update and add it to the mm23 list
- make mm23$data more self contained
- expand the mm23$data to add friendly series categories: 'annual rate' etc
- modules!

Goal: mm23 is a list containing metadata, data with friendly series descriptions,
and values for latest data and updates

Maybe additional metadata stuff?
